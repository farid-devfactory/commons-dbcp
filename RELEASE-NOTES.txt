              Apache Apache Commons DBCP
                  Version 2.2
                 RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons DBCP team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Apache Commons DBCP 2.2.

Apache Commons DBCP software implements Database Connection Pooling.

This is a minor release, including bug fixes and enhancements.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o DBCP-451:  Add constructor DriverManagerConnectionFactory(String).

Fixed Bugs:
o DBCP-454:  OSGi declarations contain multiple import headers for javax.transaction. Thanks to Philipp Marx, Matt Sicker.
o DBCP-452:  Add jmxName to properties set by BasicDataSourceFactory.  This
             enables container-managed pools created from JNDI Resource
             definitions to enable JMX by supplying a valid root JMX name.
o DBCP-446:  NullPointerException thrown when calling ManagedConnection.isClosed(). Thanks to Gary Gregory, feng yang, Euclides M, Phil Steitz.
o DBCP-444:  InvalidateConnection can result in closed connection returned by getConnection.
o DBCP-449:  Complete the fix for DBCP-418, enabling PoolableConnection class to load in environments
             (such as GAE) where the JMX ManagementFactory is not available. Thanks to Grzegorz D..
o DBCP-455:  Ensure that the cacheState setting is used when statement pooling is
             disabled. Thanks to Kyohei Nakamura.
o DBCP-453:  Ensure that setSoftMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis is used when working with
             BasicDataSource. Thanks to Philipp Marx.
o DBCP-456:  Correct the name of the configuration attribute
             softMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis. Thanks to Kyohei Nakamura.
